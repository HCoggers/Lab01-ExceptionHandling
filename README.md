# Lab01-ExceptionHandling
by Harry Cogswell

A simple math game. When you load this in your Console it will:
1. Ask you to choose a number
2. Have you fill a list of numbers, the length of your first number
3. Have you select an index number from your list
4. Multiply the full sum of the numbers in your list by the one that corresponds to the index you chose
5. Ask for a number to divide that product by
6. Return all of these great numbers to you in a full report!
